Semantic Similarity Evaluator (SSE)
===================================

Simple tool to allow an annotator to look at a source sentence, and pick the most similar sentence out of a set of sentences.

This was written as a quick tool for a very specific type of annotation for a machine translation paper, and isn't expected to be ever made into something general purpose.

Name is intentionally confusing so that as little people use it as possible. This is not a well-written piece of software.
